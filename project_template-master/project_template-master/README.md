# MDST Project Template

Based on [this repo](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) from DrivenData.


### Requirements to use the template:
-----------
 - Python 3.5+
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```


### To start a new project, run:
------------

    cookiecutter https://github.com/MichiganDataScienceTeam/project_template

When asked, select Python 3. Use default options if you're not sure what to select.

You will also need to create a repo in the MDST Github organization. Contact the VP of Projects to create this for you.

Once this is created, navigate to the new project directory, initialize, and push to Github.

```
cd myproject
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/MichiganDataScienceTeam/myproject
git add -A
git commit "initial commit"
git push origin master
```

### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project looks like this:

```
├── LICENSE
├── Makefile           <- Makefile with commands like `make data` or `make train`
├── README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.

│   ├── external       <- Data from third party sources.
│   ├── interim        <- Intermediate data that has been transformed.
│   ├── processed      <- The final, canonical data sets for modeling.
│   └── raw            <- The original, immutable data dump.

│   │   │                 predictions
│   │   ├── predict_model.py
